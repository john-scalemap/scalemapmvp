# HTTPS Migration Issue - Current Status

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Self-signed certificate rejected by browsers

---

## Original Problem

When logging in, the browser console showed:
1. `[blocked] The page at https://d2nr28qnjfjgb5.cloudfront.net/auth?mode=login requested insecure content from http://scalem-scale-rrvivslk5gxy-832498527.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/auth/user`
2. Mixed content error: HTTPS frontend ‚Üí HTTP backend (BLOCKED by browser)

---

## What We Fixed

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Changes
1. **Created SSL Certificate**
   - Generated self-signed certificate
   - Imported to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
   - ARN: `arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:884337373956:certificate/177c65e0-0f14-4aa5-b00f-41bd2876394c`

2. **Added HTTPS Listener to ALB**
   - Added listener on port 443
   - Configured to forward to existing target group (port 3000)
   - Listener ARN: `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:eu-west-1:884337373956:listener/app/Scalem-Scale-RRvIVSLk5gxy/e809fc5352183b9c/a62070f3d7e4fc34`

3. **Configured HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS Redirect**
   - Modified port 80 listener to redirect to port 443 (HTTP 301)

4. **Updated Security Group**
   - Port 443 already open on ALB security group (no changes needed)

### ‚úÖ Application Changes
1. **Updated All Environment Variables**
   - Changed `VITE_API_URL` from `http://` to `https://` in:
     - `docs-consolidated/scripts/deploy-production.sh`
     - All documentation files (6 files)
     - All deployment scripts (3 scripts)

2. **Rebuilt & Deployed Application**
   - Docker build with HTTPS URL: `https://Scalem-Scale-RRvIVSLk5gxy-832498527.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
   - Version: `v20250930-131715`
   - Deployed to ECS: ‚úÖ Success
   - Deployed to S3/CloudFront: ‚úÖ Success

3. **Verified S3 & CloudFront Content**
   - S3 bucket has correct files with HTTPS URL embedded
   - CloudFront serving fresh content (v20250930-131715)
   - No localhost references in bundle ‚úÖ
   - HTTPS URL verified in bundle ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Cognito Verification
- Client ID: `4oh46v98dsu1c8csu4tn6ddgq1`
- `GenerateSecret`: `null` (NO SECRET HASH) ‚úÖ
- Configuration correct throughout

## üö® CURRENT PROBLEM

After deploying HTTPS, users now see:

### Error 1: Redirect Loop
```
[Error] Load cannot follow more than 20 redirections
[Error] Fetch API cannot load https://d2nr28qnjfjgb5.cloudfront.net/api/auth/user due to access control checks.
```

**Cause:** CloudFront doesn't handle `/api/*` routes, creates redirect loop

### Error 2: Invalid SSL Certificate
```
[Error] The certificate for this server is invalid.
[Error] Fetch API cannot load https://scalem-scale-rrvivslk5gxy-832498527.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/auth/user due to access control checks.
```

**Cause:** Self-signed SSL certificate rejected by browsers

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Self-Signed Certificate Fails
1. Browsers **do not trust self-signed certificates** by default
2. Users see security warnings and API calls are blocked
3. Certificate is for `Scalem-Scale-RRvIVSLk5gxy-832498527.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com` (AWS ELB domain)
4. Cannot request valid public certificate for AWS-owned domain

### Why We Have This Problem
1. **Cannot get valid cert for ELB domain** - AWS owns `*.elb.amazonaws.com`
2. **Self-signed certs don't work in browsers** - Security policy blocks them
3. **Mixed content is BLOCKED** - Can't use HTTP with HTTPS frontend

---

## Current State

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ ALB with HTTPS listener (port 443) - **Certificate rejected by browsers**
- ‚úÖ ALB with HTTP listener (port 80) - Redirects to HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Self-signed certificate in ACM
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Certificate not trusted by browsers**

### Application
- ‚úÖ Frontend: `v20250930-131715` deployed
- ‚úÖ Backend: ECS service running
- ‚úÖ HTTPS URL embedded in frontend bundle
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API calls fail due to certificate rejection**

### What Works
- ‚úÖ Backend health check via HTTP (bypassing HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ Backend health check via HTTPS with `-k` flag (ignoring cert)
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads successfully

### What Doesn't Work
- ‚ùå API calls from frontend to backend (certificate rejected)
- ‚ùå User authentication (API calls blocked)
- ‚ùå Any frontend‚Üíbackend communication

## Files Modified

### Deployment Scripts
- `docs-consolidated/scripts/deploy-production.sh` - Changed to HTTPS URL
- `docs-consolidated/scripts/check-deployment-status.sh` - Changed to HTTPS URL
- `docs-consolidated/scripts/rollback-deployment.sh` - Changed to HTTPS URL
- `scripts/deploy-auth-improvements.sh` - Changed to HTTPS URL

### Documentation
- `docs-consolidated/deployment-guide.md` - Updated all HTTP to HTTPS
- `docs-consolidated/environment-config.md` - Updated endpoints
- `docs-consolidated/current-state.md` - Updated current URLs
- `docs-consolidated/troubleshooting-guide.md` - Updated examples
- `docs-consolidated/quick-reference.md` - Updated commands
- `docs-consolidated/version-sync-procedures.md` - Updated procedures

### Application Code
- No changes needed - `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` already handles `VITE_API_URL` correctly

## Summary

**Current blocker:** Self-signed certificates are rejected by browsers. We cannot proceed with current HTTPS setup.

**Impact:** Application is non-functional - users cannot authenticate or make any API calls.
