# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
ScaleMap's interface embodies "Growth Bottleneck Surgery" - precise, professional, and confidence-inspiring. The experience should feel like working with a boutique consulting team that delivers enterprise-grade insights with startup speed. Clean, data-rich visualizations that make complex operational analysis immediately actionable for busy founders and COOs.

## Key Interaction Paradigms  
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex domain analysis presented in digestible layers (executive summary → detailed heatmaps → implementation kits)
- **Expert Guidance Navigation:** Interface guides users through 12 domain assessment with clear progress indicators and contextual help
- **Data-Driven Storytelling:** Visual heatmaps and priority rankings tell the operational health story before diving into details  
- **Implementation-Focused:** Every insight connects directly to actionable next steps with downloadable templates and guides

## Core Screens and Views
**Authentication & Onboarding Flow**
- Secure login with company profile setup
- Industry selection (regulated/non-regulated) for domain customization
- Assessment launch with clear expectations and timeline

**Comprehensive Assessment Interface**  
- 12-domain diagnostic questionnaire with smart progress tracking
- Document upload zones for supporting evidence
- Industry-specific question branching and validation

**Analysis Dashboard**
- Real-time processing status with domain agent activity indicators and triage results
- Agent personality cards showing activated experts (3-5 of 12 based on triage)
- Executive summary presentation with visual heatmap
- Gap identification and client feedback mechanism

**Results & Implementation Center**
- Interactive domain heatmaps with drill-down capabilities
- Priority recommendation cards with implementation complexity ratings and agent attribution
- Downloadable playbook kits and template library
- Progress tracking for implementation milestones

## Single Trusted Advisor Interface (Phase 1: MVP)
- Primary advisor persona (e.g., "Sarah, your operational strategist") as single point of client contact
- Background team attribution showing specialist consultations ("Sarah consulted with our financial experts...")
- Processing status indicators showing advisor coordination ("Sarah is analyzing with domain specialists...")
- Clean advisor profile with team expertise showcase and modern UI design trends

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Professional business users require screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and color-blind friendly visualizations for heatmaps and data representations.

## Branding
Clean, professional aesthetic that conveys expertise and trustworthiness. Data visualization should feel sophisticated but not overwhelming - think "McKinsey-quality insights with startup accessibility." Color palette supporting operational health status (red/amber/green) while maintaining accessibility standards. Agent personalities should feel premium and trustworthy rather than gimmicky.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive  
Desktop-first experience optimized for business users working through comprehensive assessments and reviewing detailed analysis. Responsive design ensures executive summary and key insights are accessible on mobile for founders on-the-go.
