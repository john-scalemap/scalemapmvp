# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Launch ScaleMap as the leading "Growth Bottleneck Intelligence" platform delivering Perfect Prioritization for scaling companies
- Achieve £300-500K ARR within 12 months through AI-automated delivery model maintaining 72-hour turnaround
- Establish new category leadership by proving 70% of implementing clients achieve 20%+ growth acceleration within 90 days
- Build automation-first architecture enabling solopreneur scalability with minimal founder intervention per client
- Create competitive moat through Perfect Prioritization algorithm that identifies the 2-3 operational changes unlocking 80% of growth potential

## Background Context

ScaleMap addresses the critical frustration that scaling companies (Series A+, £1M+ revenue) face with traditional strategy consulting. These companies know operational inefficiencies are blocking growth but are trapped in a lose-lose situation: they reluctantly pay £50K+ for consulting that delivers slow, generic recommendations without implementation support, or they struggle with internal operational chaos while growth stalls.

The platform transforms consulting from "expensive advice" to "growth bottleneck surgery" - using AI-powered analysis to surgically identify minimum viable operational changes that unlock maximum growth potential. Unlike traditional 6-8 week consulting engagements, ScaleMap delivers comprehensive diagnostics, visual heatmap reports, and ready-to-implement playbook kits within 72 hours for £5-8K.
