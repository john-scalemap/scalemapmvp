# Story 1.3: API Container Build & ECS Fargate Deployment (Phase 1 Complete)

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** ScaleMap user,
**I want** the Express API running on ECS Fargate with ALB routing,
**so that** I can register, login, complete assessments, upload documents, and submit without any service interruption.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Multi-stage Dockerfile created in `/server/Dockerfile` using Node.js 20-alpine base image with TypeScript compilation in build stage and production dependencies in runtime stage (<500MB final image)
2. `.dockerignore` configured to exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, `*.test.ts`, `.env` files, reducing image build context size
3. ECR repository created via CDK, Docker image built locally and pushed to ECR with tag `scalemap-api:v1.0`
4. ECS cluster created (`scalemap-cluster`), Fargate task definition configured: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, secrets injected from Secrets Manager as environment variables
5. ECS service deployed with ALB target group, health check endpoint `GET /api/health` responding 200 OK, minimum 1 task running
6. Application Load Balancer created in public subnets, listener on port 443 with SSL certificate (ACM), forwarding to ECS target group on port 3000
7. React frontend built (`npm run build` in `/client`), deployed to S3 bucket with CloudFront distribution, API calls routed to ALB endpoint

## Integration Verification

**IV1: End-to-End User Flow Verification** - Complete full user journey in production: register new user via Cognito → login → complete 12-domain assessment questionnaire → upload 3 test documents to S3 → submit assessment successfully (stored in RDS)

**IV2: Authentication & Session Verification** - Validate Cognito JWT token flow: login returns valid token, protected API endpoints reject requests without token, session persists in PostgreSQL session store across multiple requests

**IV3: Performance & Monitoring Verification** - Confirm API response times <3 seconds for all endpoints, CloudWatch Logs capture structured JSON logs with correlation IDs, CloudWatch Metrics show ECS CPU <50% under test load

### Docker Configuration Details
[Source: architecture.md - Infrastructure and Deployment section]

**Multi-Stage Build Pattern:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Runtime stage
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

**Image Optimization:**
- Target: <500MB final image
- Use Node.js 20-alpine (smaller than standard image)
- Multi-stage build separates build dependencies from runtime
- .dockerignore excludes: node_modules, .git, *.test.ts, .env, coverage/, .vscode/

2. **Docker Build Tests**: Ensure image builds without errors, size <500MB
3. **ECS Deployment Tests**: Verify task reaches RUNNING state, responds to ALB health checks
4. **Integration Verification Tests**: Automated tests for IV1, IV2, IV3 criteria
5. **Load Testing**: Artillery test with 10 concurrent users for performance verification

### Cost Considerations
[Source: architecture.md - Cost Analysis section]

**Expected Costs for This Story:**
- **ECS Fargate API Service**: $15-20/month (1 vCPU, 2GB, always-on)
- **ALB**: $16/month (not Free Tier eligible)
- **CloudFront**: $0/month (1TB data transfer covered by Free Tier)
- **S3**: $0-5/month (5GB storage covered by Free Tier)
- **Total Story Impact**: ~$31-41/month

**Cost Monitoring:**
- CloudWatch billing alerts at $10, $20, $50, $100 (configured in Story 1.1)
- Daily AWS Cost Explorer review during first 2 weeks post-deployment

### Deployment Strategy
[Source: architecture.md - Infrastructure and Deployment section]

**Phase 1 Deployment (This Story):**
1. Build and push Docker image to ECR
2. Deploy ECS cluster and Fargate task definition via CDK
3. Create ALB and configure target group
4. Deploy ECS service with rolling update strategy
5. Build React app and deploy to S3
6. Create CloudFront distribution
7. Run integration verification tests
8. Monitor for 24 hours before marking story complete

**Rollback Procedures:**
- **ECS Service**: Update service to previous task definition revision (< 2 minutes)
- **Docker Image**: Tag previous image as `:latest` and redeploy
- **Frontend**: Revert S3 bucket to previous object versions
- **Trigger Conditions**: Error rate > 5%, health checks failing, user-reported issues

### Critical Dependencies & Prerequisites
1. **Story 1.1 Complete**: VPC, security groups, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch setup
2. **Story 1.2 Complete**: RDS PostgreSQL deployed, database migrations applied
3. **AWS Services Configured**: ECR repository created, ACM certificate issued
4. **Existing Code Verified**: Express API, React client, Cognito/S3 integrations working locally

### Known Risks & Mitigations
[Source: architecture.md - Risk Assessment section]

**Container Networking Complexity:**
- **Risk**: ECS tasks can't reach RDS/S3 due to security group misconfiguration
- **Mitigation**: Verify security group rules before deployment, test connectivity with bastion host

**Docker Build Failures in CI/CD:**
- **Risk**: Image builds locally but fails in GitHub Actions with dependency errors
- **Mitigation**: Use exact Node.js version match (20-alpine), comprehensive .dockerignore, layer caching in ECR

**Database Connection Pool Exhaustion:**
- **Risk**: ECS auto-scaling creates too many tasks, exceeds RDS max_connections=100
- **Mitigation**: Limit max connections per task (10), set ECS max task count (5 for API)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Overall Assessment

**Gate Status: CONCERNS** ⚠️

Story 1.3 achieved functional deployment after extensive troubleshooting, demonstrating team resilience and problem-solving capability. However, the **72-minute deployment recovery** and **6 rebuild cycles** reveal critical gaps in containerization testing, infrastructure validation, and deployment process maturity. While the system is now operational and meeting performance SLAs, the path to production exposed systemic weaknesses that require immediate remediation.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ All 7 acceptance criteria functionally met (AC6 partial - HTTP only)
- ✅ ECS Fargate infrastructure deployed and stable (1/1 tasks healthy)
- ✅ Performance well within spec (39-221ms response times vs 3s SLA)
- ✅ Comprehensive break-fix documentation created (432-minute incident timeline)
- ✅ Integration tests created and passing (7/7)

**Critical Concerns:**
- ❌ No container-specific testing caught Vite import failures before deployment
- ❌ Database SSL configuration required 3 rebuild cycles to resolve
- ❌ Missing environment variable caused 2+ hour CloudFormation stack hang
- ❌ Production running HTTP-only (HTTPS listener not configured)
- ❌ Deployment process lacks automated validation gates

### Deployment Incident Analysis

**Timeline Summary:**
- **09:38 AM** - Initial CDK deployment started
- **10:42 AM** - First ECS task failure (Vite module not found)
- **11:46 AM** - Build #19 succeeded after frontend integration fix
- **12:22 PM** - Build #20 deployed with database SSL resolution
- **13:12 PM** - Final stack recovery, all services operational

**Root Causes Identified:**

1. **Vite Dynamic Import Failure** (72 min to resolve)
   - **Issue**: Top-level `import { setupVite } from "./vite"` executed even in production
   - **Impact**: Container crashed immediately with MODULE_NOT_FOUND
   - **Resolution**: Converted to dynamic imports inside conditional blocks
   - **Learning**: Development dependencies must never be statically imported in production bundles
   - **Files**: server/index.ts:603-609, server/vite.ts

2. **Database SSL Certificate Validation** (26 min to resolve)
   - **Issue**: Node.js pg library rejected AWS RDS certificate as self-signed
   - **Impact**: Health checks failed despite app startup, blocking deployment
   - **Resolution**: Added `checkServerIdentity: () => undefined` SSL override
   - **Learning**: RDS SSL connections require explicit certificate handling
   - **Files**: server/db.ts:811-820

3. **Missing Environment Variable** (S3_BUCKET_NAME)
   - **Issue**: Variable not defined in ECS task definition
   - **Impact**: CloudFormation stack stuck in CREATE_IN_PROGRESS for 2+ hours
   - **Resolution**: Added to compute.ts:137, deleted stuck stack, redeployed
   - **Learning**: Environment variable completeness should be infrastructure-tested
   - **Files**: infrastructure/lib/stacks/compute.ts:137

4. **Frontend Build Integration**
   - **Issue**: Docker image missing client build artifacts
   - **Impact**: serveStatic() failed to find /dist/public directory
   - **Resolution**: Added `npx vite build` to Dockerfile, fixed smart-package.sh
   - **Learning**: Multi-stage builds must include all runtime dependencies
   - **Files**: server/Dockerfile:15, scripts/smart-package.sh:665

### Code Quality Assessment

**Architecture & Design: B+**
- ✅ CDK infrastructure well-structured with proper stack separation
- ✅ Multi-stage Dockerfile follows best practices (build/runtime separation)
- ✅ ECS task definition properly configured (secrets, logging, auto-scaling)
- ⚠️ Wildcard S3 IAM permissions (should be bucket-specific)
- ⚠️ No HTTPS listener configured (security gap)

**Test Coverage: C**
- ✅ Integration tests created post-deployment (7 tests passing)
- ✅ Health endpoint validation comprehensive
- ❌ **No container integration tests** - Docker issues found only at deployment
- ❌ **No infrastructure validation tests** - missing env vars not caught
- ❌ **Manual verification required** for IV1 end-to-end flow
- **Recommendation**: Create Docker test suite with LocalStack, validate builds in CI

**Error Handling & Resilience: B**
- ✅ Health check endpoint properly validates all dependencies (DB, S3, Cognito)
- ✅ ECS auto-scaling configured appropriately (1-3 tasks)
- ✅ Comprehensive CloudWatch logging with structured JSON
- ⚠️ Database SSL handling required multiple iterations to stabilize
- ⚠️ No automated rollback on deployment failures

**Security Posture: C+**
- ✅ Secrets properly injected via AWS Secrets Manager
- ✅ ECS tasks in private subnets with NAT egress
- ✅ 401 enforcement on protected endpoints verified
- ❌ **HTTP-only ALB listener** (HTTPS not configured)
- ❌ **SSL certificate validation bypassed** (checkServerIdentity override)
- ❌ **Wildcard S3 permissions** (overly permissive IAM)
- **Critical**: Must provision ACM certificate and add HTTPS before production

### NFR Assessment

**Security: CONCERNS** ⚠️
- HTTP-only deployment is not production-ready
- SSL certificate validation workaround acceptable for MVP but needs documentation
- Wildcard S3 IAM permissions violate least privilege principle
- **Action Required**: Configure HTTPS, restrict S3 permissions

**Performance: PASS** ✅
- API response times: 39-221ms (well under 3s SLA)
- ECS CPU utilization: <50% under test load
- CloudWatch metrics properly configured
- Auto-scaling triggers set appropriately (70% CPU, 80% memory)

**Reliability: CONCERNS** ⚠️
- Service is stable post-deployment (1/1 tasks healthy)
- **But**: 6 rebuild cycles required to achieve stability
- Manual intervention needed for CloudFormation stack recovery
- No automated rollback mechanisms
- **Action Required**: Harden deployment pipeline, add validation gates

**Maintainability: PASS** ✅
- CDK infrastructure readable and well-organized
- Comprehensive break-fix documentation (deployment-break-fix-analysis.md)
- Lessons learned captured for future reference
- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for layer caching

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ TypeScript strict mode, ESLint compliance verified
- **Project Structure**: ✅ CDK stacks follow architecture.md patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ Integration tests created but container testing gap exists
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ 6/7 fully met, AC6 partial (HTTP vs HTTPS)

### Technical Debt Identified

**High Priority:**
1. **Missing Container Integration Tests** - No Docker build validation before deployment
   - **Impact**: Critical failures only discovered in production environment
   - **Effort**: 4 hours to create Docker test suite with LocalStack
   - **Recommendation**: Add to Sprint 2 as dedicated story

2. **HTTP-Only Deployment** - HTTPS listener not configured
   - **Impact**: Security vulnerability, data in transit not encrypted
   - **Effort**: 2 hours (ACM cert provision + ALB config)
   - **Recommendation**: Complete before production traffic

3. **Environment Variable Validation** - No infrastructure tests
   - **Impact**: Missing vars cause runtime failures, stack hangs
   - **Effort**: 2 hours to add validation tests to infrastructure/test/
   - **Recommendation**: Add to CI/CD pipeline immediately

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Wildcard S3 IAM Permissions** - Overly broad resource access
   - **Impact**: Violates least privilege, audit finding risk
   - **Effort**: 1 hour to scope to specific bucket ARNs
   - **Recommendation**: Address in security hardening story

5. **No Automated Rollback** - Manual intervention required for failures
   - **Impact**: Extended downtime risk, manual ops burden
   - **Effort**: 3 hours to implement health-check-based rollback
   - **Recommendation**: Add to reliability improvements backlog

**Low Priority:**
6. **Manual IV1 Testing** - End-to-end flow not fully automated
   - **Impact**: Regression risk, slower validation cycles
   - **Effort**: 4 hours to create E2E Puppeteer tests
   - **Recommendation**: Address in next epic

### Lessons Learned & Best Practices

**Containerization:**
1. ✅ **Always use dynamic imports for dev-only dependencies** in production containers
2. ✅ **Multi-stage builds must include ALL runtime assets** (frontend, static files, etc.)
3. ✅ **Test Docker images locally before AWS deployment** - add to dev workflow

**Database Connections:**
1. ✅ **RDS SSL requires explicit certificate handling** - document pattern in coding standards
2. ✅ **ECS secret updates need task restart, not just deployment** - critical ops knowledge
3. ✅ **Health checks should validate connectivity, not just startup** - already implemented well

**Infrastructure as Code:**
1. ✅ **Validate environment variables in infrastructure tests** - prevent runtime discovery
2. ✅ **CloudFormation stack timeouts need monitoring/auto-recovery** - add to CDK patterns
3. ✅ **Comprehensive break-fix docs are invaluable** - continue practice

### Files Modified During Review

**No code modifications performed by QA.** All issues identified for developer action.

**Files requiring developer attention:**
- `infrastructure/lib/stacks/compute.ts` - Add HTTPS listener, restrict S3 IAM
- `tests/integration/docker/` - Create new test suite (does not exist)
- `infrastructure/test/compute.test.ts` - Add environment variable validation
- `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` - Add Docker validation gate
- `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Document RDS SSL pattern

### Gate Decision

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/1.3-api-container-ecs-deployment.yml`

**Status Reason:** Deployment successful after significant troubleshooting. Multiple critical issues resolved during implementation reveal systemic gaps in containerization expertise and testing strategy. Production readiness achieved but technical debt and process improvements needed.

**Quality Score: 65/100**
- High severity issues: 2 (DEPLOY-001, DEPLOY-002)
- Medium severity issues: 3 (DEPLOY-003, TEST-001, HTTPS-001)

**Risk Profile:** `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-risk-20250924.md` (not created - manual review)

**Top Issues Summary:**
1. 🔴 **DEPLOY-001**: 72-min recovery for Vite import failures - add CI validation
2. 🔴 **DEPLOY-002**: Database SSL required 3 rebuild cycles - document pattern
3. 🟡 **DEPLOY-003**: Missing env var caused 2hr stack hang - add infra tests
4. 🟡 **TEST-001**: No container tests exist - create Docker test suite
5. 🟡 **HTTPS-001**: HTTP-only ALB - provision ACM & configure HTTPS

### Immediate Actions Required

**Before Marking Story "Done":**
1. ✅ Provision ACM certificate for app.scalemap.com (2 hours)
2. ✅ Add HTTPS listener to ALB in compute.ts (30 min)
3. ✅ Add Docker build validation to GitHub Actions CI (1 hour)
4. ✅ Create infrastructure test for required environment variables (1 hour)
5. ⏳ Document RDS SSL connection pattern in coding standards (30 min)

**Estimated Effort to Address Concerns: 5 hours**
