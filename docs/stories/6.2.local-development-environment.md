## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 6.1 (Pre-Migration Readiness):
- Comprehensive migration documentation and checklists created
- Pre-migration assessment procedures established
- Backup and rollback procedures documented
- Troubleshooting guide available for common migration issues
- Documentation-focused completion provides foundation for implementation

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/aws-migration-architecture.md]

**Current State Dependencies to Replace:**
- `server/replitAuth.ts` → AWS Cognito integration
- `server/objectStorage.ts` → AWS S3 integration
- `@neondatabase/serverless` → Standard PostgreSQL client for RDS

**Critical File Locations:**
- Authentication: `server/replitAuth.ts`
- Object Storage: `server/objectStorage.ts`
- Database: `server/db.ts`
- Schema: `shared/schema.ts`

**Migration Sequence Requirements:**
- Phase 1: Infrastructure provisioning and AWS service setup (Week 1)
- Phase 2: Code migration - authentication, storage, and database updates (Week 2)
- Phase 3: Data migration and cutover with rollback capability (Week 3)

**AWS Free Tier Constraints:**
- RDS PostgreSQL: 750 hours/month db.t3.micro + 20GB storage
- S3: 5GB storage + 20K GET/2K PUT requests
- Cognito: 50,000 MAUs permanently
- EC2: 750 hours/month t3.micro via Elastic Beanstalk

**Cost Management:**
- Stay within $120 credit budget during migration and initial MVP phase
- Estimated $15-30/month within Free Tier limits
- Implement cost monitoring and alerts at $20, $50, $100

### Testing

Testing requirements focus on validation and environment setup:
- Local development environment must successfully run existing codebase
- Database backup/restore integrity testing with row count validation
- File backup integrity testing with checksum verification
- AWS CLI connectivity testing to verify service access
- Parallel testing environment validation before migration

### Code Quality Assessment

**COMPREHENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP WITH CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS**

This story successfully establishes a complete local development environment and AWS migration preparation foundation. The implementation demonstrates thorough infrastructure setup with excellent documentation and validation procedures. However, significant security and testing concerns require immediate attention before production migration.

**Strengths:**
- Complete local PostgreSQL setup with schema validation
- Comprehensive AWS SDK integration and connectivity testing
- Detailed environment documentation and migration mapping
- Automated testing framework for AWS environment validation
- Well-structured dependency management and version documentation

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** - Infrastructure setup story focuses on environment configuration rather than application code changes.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ⚠️ Not applicable - infrastructure setup story
- **Project Structure:** ✓ All new files follow documented patterns in docs/ and scripts/
- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ Missing test coverage for critical security components
- **All ACs Met:** ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria completed with documented evidence

### Security Review

**🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY CONCERNS IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Credential Exposure Risk:** AWS credentials configured in development environment without secure storage validation
2. **Authentication Transition Risk:** Replit OpenID → Cognito migration lacks security validation testing
3. **Database Security Gap:** Local PostgreSQL setup lacks security hardening validation
4. **File Storage Security:** S3 migration approach needs IAM policy validation

**Risk Assessment:** HIGH - Authentication and credential management components touched without comprehensive security testing.

### Improvements Checklist

**IMMEDIATE (Must Fix Before Production):**
- [ ] Add AWS credential security validation tests
- [ ] Implement Cognito authentication integration tests
- [ ] Add database connection security validation
- [ ] Create S3 IAM policy validation tests
- [ ] Add rate limiting tests for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement credential rotation testing procedures

**FUTURE (Recommended):**
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking for local vs. cloud environments
- [ ] Create automated backup integrity validation
- [ ] Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting tests
- [ ] Add disaster recovery validation procedures

### Performance Considerations

Local development environment successfully mirrors production architecture requirements. AWS testing framework validates connectivity and basic operations. No performance bottlenecks identified in setup phase.

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified during review** - Infrastructure story requires validation testing additions rather than code refactoring.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/6.2-local-development-environment.yml
Risk level: HIGH (security components without test coverage)
NFR Status: Security=FAIL, Performance=PASS, Reliability=CONCERNS, Maintainability=PASS

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Critical security test coverage must be added before AWS migration implementation. Story owner should address security testing gaps before proceeding to production migration phases.

2. **Authentication Security**: Cognito integration tests cover user pool validation, authentication flows, and security configurations
3. **Database Security**: PostgreSQL connection security validation with SSL configuration testing
4. **Integration Security**: End-to-end AWS service integration security testing framework

**Risk Assessment Updated:** HIGH → LOW (security testing framework operational)

### Updated Gate Status
