# Story 1.1: AWS Infrastructure Foundation & Networking Setup

**Status:** Done

## Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** to provision AWS networking infrastructure and foundational services via CDK,
**so that** ECS Fargate, RDS, and other services have secure VPC connectivity before application deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AWS CDK project initialized in `/infrastructure` directory with TypeScript configuration and modular stack architecture
2. Networking stack deployed with VPC (CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16), public subnets (2 AZs for ALB), private subnets (2 AZs for ECS/RDS)
3. Security groups configured: ALB (port 80/443 from internet), ECS (port 3000 from ALB), RDS (port 5432 from ECS only)
4. Internet Gateway attached to VPC with route tables directing public subnet traffic to IGW and private subnet traffic to NAT Gateway
5. AWS Secrets Manager secrets created for production: `/scalemap/prod/database-url`, `/scalemap/prod/openai-api-key`, `/scalemap/prod/stripe-secret-key`, `/scalemap/prod/cognito-config`
6. CloudWatch Log groups created: `/ecs/scalemap-api` (30-day retention), `/ecs/scalemap-agents` (30-day retention)
7. Billing alerts configured via CloudWatch Alarms at $10, $20, $50, $100 thresholds with SNS email notifications

**CDK Stack Dependencies** [Source: docs/aws-ecs-migration-prd.md - Risk Assessment]
- Deploy order: Networking → Compute → Events → Workflows
- Avoid circular dependencies by using explicit stack references
- Export VPC ID, subnet IDs, security group IDs for downstream stacks

### Actual Secret Values (Provided by Product Owner)

**IMPORTANT**: Use these actual values when creating Secrets Manager entries in Task 4.

```bash
# Database URL (to be updated with actual RDS endpoint after Story 1.2)
/scalemap/prod/database-url: "postgresql://scalemap_user:PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD@PLACEHOLDER_RDS_ENDPOINT:5432/scalemap?ssl=true"

# OpenAI API Key
/scalemap/prod/openai-api-key: "PLACEHOLDER_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Stripe Secret Key (using test key for initial deployment)
/scalemap/prod/stripe-secret-key: "PLACEHOLDER_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"

# Stripe Publishable Key (for reference - stored in frontend env vars, not Secrets Manager)
# pk_test_51S9UtWPMQGIPehV3Y1s3L9UT9UoF5IP6vNcE3a93cS2Quzf6WiiDywwVVc3vGAOfYuC3FqxduxwX0hV7uRXsqM4H00KDbCClOA

# Cognito Configuration (from completed Epic 6 - Story 6.4)
/scalemap/prod/cognito-config: '{
  "userPoolId": "eu-west-1_iGWQ7N6sH",
  "clientId": "6e7ct8tmbmhgvva2ngdn5hi6v1",
  "region": "eu-west-1"
}'
```

**NOTES**:
- Database URL will be updated in Story 1.2 after RDS deployment
- Using Stripe test keys (`sk_test_*`) for initial deployment - switch to live keys (`sk_live_*`) before production launch
- Cognito Client ID needs to be retrieved from AWS Console (User Pool: eu-west-1_iGWQ7N6sH)

### Technical Constraints

**AWS Region** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Cloud Infrastructure]
- Primary region: eu-west-1 (Ireland)
- All resources must be deployed in eu-west-1 for consistency
- AWS CLI default region confirmed: eu-west-1 ✅

**TypeScript & CDK Version** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Tech Stack]
- TypeScript: 5.6.3
- AWS CDK: 2.x (use latest stable 2.x version)
- Node.js: 20.x LTS

**Risk Mitigation** [Source: docs/aws-ecs-migration-prd.md - Risk Assessment]
- **Container Networking Complexity**: Deploy minimal networking stack first, validate connectivity with bastion before API deployment
- **VPC Design**: Requires both public subnets (ALB) and private subnets (ECS tasks, RDS)
- **NAT Gateway Cost**: ~$32/month unavoidable cost for private subnet internet access

### Testing

**Infrastructure Validation** [Source: docs/aws-ecs-migration-prd.md - Story 1.1 Integration Verification]

1. **Network Connectivity Test (IV1)**:
   - Deploy temporary EC2 bastion host in public subnet
   - Validate SSH access from external network
   - Test connectivity to RDS endpoint in private subnet (confirms security group and routing)

2. **Secrets Access Test (IV2)**:
   - Use AWS CLI from bastion: `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id /scalemap/prod/database-url`
   - Confirm all required secrets exist and are readable with correct IAM permissions

3. **Cost Baseline Test (IV3)**:
   - Check AWS Cost Explorer for service costs
   - Confirm VPC, security groups show $0 (Free Tier)
   - Verify NAT Gateway cost ~$32/month appears correctly
   - Ensure total infrastructure cost within budget expectations

**CDK Validation** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Infrastructure as Code]
- Run `cdk synth` to generate CloudFormation template (must succeed without errors)
- Run `cdk diff` to preview changes before deployment
- Use `cdk deploy --require-approval never` for automated deployments (CI/CD)

**No Unit Tests Required**: Infrastructure as Code validated through CDK synth and integration tests

- **Evidence**: `/infrastructure` directory with bin/scalemap.ts, lib/stacks/networking.ts, cdk.json, package.json
- **Coverage**: ✓ COMPLETE

**AC2: Networking Stack with VPC and Subnets**
- **Given** need for isolated cloud networking

### Security Review

**Status: PASS with CONCERNS**

**Critical Security Issue Found:**
- **Severity: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Secrets are stored using `SecretValue.unsafePlainText()` which embeds plaintext secrets in CloudFormation templates and stack outputs
- **Location**: networking.ts:85-115 (all four secrets)
- **Risk**: API keys and credentials visible in CloudFormation console, CloudTrail logs, and potentially version control
- **Impact**: OpenAI API key, Stripe secret key, and database credentials exposed

**Required Remediation:**
1. **DO NOT store secrets in CDK code** - Use one of these secure approaches:
   - **Option A (Recommended)**: Use AWS Console/CLI to create secrets manually, then reference by ARN in CDK:
     ```typescript
     this.openaiApiKeySecret = secretsmanager.Secret.fromSecretNameV2(
       this, 'OpenAIApiKeySecret', '/scalemap/prod/openai-api-key'
     );
     ```
   - **Option B**: Use CDK SecretValue with external parameter:
     ```typescript
     secretStringValue: cdk.SecretValue.secretsManager('existing-secret-arn')
     ```
   - **Option C**: Generate secrets in CDK but retrieve values from SSM Parameter Store (encrypted)

2. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - Rotate all exposed API keys (OpenAI, Stripe)
   - Update secrets outside of CDK code
   - Modify CDK to reference existing secrets

**Other Security Observations:**
- ✓ Security groups follow least-privilege principle with source-based ingress rules
- ✓ Private subnets properly isolated from direct internet access
- ✓ NAT Gateway provides controlled egress for private resources
- ✓ Log retention configured (30 days) for audit trail

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

- ✓ NAT Gateway provides high-bandwidth egress for private subnets (~45 Gbps)
- ✓ Multi-AZ deployment ensures availability and fault tolerance
- ✓ VPC CIDR sizing (10.0.0.0/16) allows ~65k IPs for future growth
- ✓ Security group rule chaining is efficient (no performance impact)

**Cost Optimization Note:**
- NAT Gateway cost ~$32/month is acceptable per story requirements
- Consider NAT instance for dev environments to reduce costs (production NAT Gateway is appropriate)

### Reliability Considerations

**Status: PASS**

- ✓ Multi-AZ architecture provides high availability
- ✓ Separate public/private subnets enable defense-in-depth
- ✓ CloudFormation outputs enable proper cross-stack dependencies
- ✓ Billing alarms provide proactive cost monitoring
- ✓ Log groups ready for observability in future stories

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

- ✓ Clear, readable TypeScript code with descriptive variable names
- ✓ Proper use of CDK L2 constructs (high-level abstractions)
- ✓ Modular stack design supports future infrastructure additions
- ✓ Comprehensive CloudFormation exports for downstream stacks
- ✓ Package.json uses specific CDK version (2.216.0) for reproducibility

### Testability Assessment

**Status: PASS**

- ✓ **Controllability**: CDK constructs are testable via snapshot tests (test infrastructure exists)
- ✓ **Observability**: CloudFormation outputs expose all key resource IDs/ARNs
- ✓ **Debuggability**: CDK synth/diff commands enable pre-deployment validation
- ✓ **Integration Testing**: Story includes comprehensive IV validation (bastion host testing completed per Dev Agent Record)

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. All code meets quality standards as-is.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-aws-infrastructure-foundation-networking.yml

**Reason**: Critical security issue with plaintext secrets in CDK code requires immediate remediation before production use.

### Top Issues

1. **[HIGH SEVERITY]** Secrets stored as plaintext in CDK code - rotate keys and use secure secret management
   - **Suggested Owner**: dev
   - **Action**: Implement Option A (reference existing secrets) or Option B (external parameters)

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Must Fix Before Production):**
1. **Rotate all exposed API keys**: OpenAI and Stripe keys are compromised if this code is in version control
2. **Refactor secret management**: Use `Secret.fromSecretNameV2()` to reference pre-created secrets
3. **Verify .gitignore**: Ensure CDK synthesized output (`cdk.out/`) is not committed

**Future Enhancements (Story 1.2+):**
1. Consider extracting secret ARNs to environment variables or SSM parameters for flexibility
2. Add KMS customer-managed keys for log group encryption (currently using AWS-managed)
3. Implement VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis
4. Add automated secret rotation for database credentials (mentioned in AC5 but not implemented)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Security Issue Must Be Addressed**

The infrastructure is functionally complete and well-architected, but the security vulnerability with plaintext secrets cannot proceed to production. After secret management is remediated, this story will be ready for Done.

**Story owner decides final status.**
