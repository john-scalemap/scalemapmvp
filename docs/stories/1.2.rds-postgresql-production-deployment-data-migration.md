# Story 1.2: RDS PostgreSQL Production Deployment & Data Migration

**Status:** Done

## Story

**As a** database administrator,
**I want** to deploy production RDS PostgreSQL instance and migrate data from development/staging,
**so that** the ECS Fargate API has a production database ready with existing assessment data preserved.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. RDS PostgreSQL 16.x instance created via CDK in private subnets with Multi-AZ disabled (Free Tier: db.t3.micro, 20GB storage)
2. Database security group allows inbound port 5432 only from ECS security group, denies all other traffic
3. Automated backups enabled (7-day retention), maintenance window set to Sunday 3-5 AM UTC
4. Database connection string stored in AWS Secrets Manager at `/scalemap/prod/database-url` with format: `postgresql://username:password@rds-endpoint:5432/scalemap?ssl=true`
5. Drizzle ORM migrations executed against production RDS: `DATABASE_URL=<secrets-value> npm run db:push` completes successfully
6. Data export from staging/development RDS completed using `pg_dump`, import to production RDS verified with row count validation across all tables (users, assessments, documents, agent_analyses)
7. SSL/TLS connection validated: Test connection from bastion host using `psql` with `?ssl=true` parameter confirms encrypted connection

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 1.1 Completed** - AWS Infrastructure Foundation & Networking Setup [Source: docs/stories/1.1.aws-infrastructure-foundation-networking.md]
- VPC deployed with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16, 2 public subnets (eu-west-1a/1b), 2 private subnets (eu-west-1a/1b)
- Security groups created: ALB (80/443), ECS (3000 from ALB), **RDS (5432 from ECS only)** ✓
- NAT Gateway deployed for private subnet internet access (~$32/month)
- Secrets Manager configured with `/scalemap/prod/database-url` placeholder (to be updated with actual RDS endpoint in this story)
- CloudWatch log groups created: /ecs/scalemap-api, /ecs/scalemap-agents
- **NetworkingStack exports**: vpcId, publicSubnetIds, privateSubnetIds, albSecurityGroupId, ecsSecurityGroupId, **rdsSecurityGroupId** ✓
- **CRITICAL**: Story 1.1 QA identified security issue with plaintext secrets - secrets now managed via `Secret.fromSecretNameV2()` pattern

### Architecture References

**Database Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Tech Stack]
- **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL 16.x
- **ORM**: Drizzle 0.39.1 for type-safe database access
- **Connection**: Standard `pg` client with SSL enabled for production
- **Connection String Format**: `postgresql://username:password@rds-endpoint:5432/scalemap?ssl=true`

**RDS Configuration** [Source: docs/aws-ecs-migration-prd.md - Story 1.2 AC & NFR5]
- **Instance Type**: db.t3.micro (Free Tier eligible: 750 hours/month for 12 months)
- **Storage**: 20GB gp3 with encryption enabled (Free Tier: 20GB)
- **Multi-AZ**: Disabled to stay within Free Tier (enable in production for HA)
- **Backups**: 7-day retention, automated daily backups
- **Maintenance Window**: Sunday 3-5 AM UTC (low-traffic period)
- **Security**: Private subnets only, port 5432 from ECS security group exclusively
- **Connection Pooling**: Max 100 connections (db.t3.micro limit), reserve 10 connections per ECS task → max 10 tasks

**Database Schema** [Source: shared/schema.ts & docs/architecture.md - Database Schema]

**Existing Schema in `/shared/schema.ts`**:
- `sessions` - Session storage for authentication (Replit legacy, will migrate to Cognito sessions)
- `users` - User accounts with Cognito integration fields (email, cognitoUserId, companyName, industry, etc.)
- `assessments` - Core assessment entity (status enum: pending, in_progress, awaiting_payment, paid, analysis, completed, failed)
- `assessmentDomains` - Domain-specific analysis results (domainName, score, health enum, agentId FK)
- `agents` - AI agent definitions (referenced by assessmentDomains)

**Required Schema from Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Database Schema]:
- `assessment_responses` - Questionnaire answers (assessmentId FK, questionId, domainId enum, responseValue JSONB, confidenceScore)
- `documents` - Uploaded files (assessmentId FK, fileName, s3Key, fileType, domainTags array)
- `agent_analyses` - Agent findings (assessmentId FK, agentId, agentPersona, domainFindings JSONB, healthScore, recommendations JSONB)
- `deliverables` - Staged outputs (assessmentId FK, deliveryStage enum: executive_summary/detailed_report/implementation_kit, s3Key, clientFeedback JSONB)
- `payments` - Stripe transactions (userId FK, assessmentId FK, stripePaymentIntentId, amount, status enum)
- `agent_prompts` - System prompts per agent (agentId unique, systemPrompt text, version, isActive boolean)

**NOTE**: The current schema.ts has `assessmentDomains` table which overlaps with the architecture's `agent_analyses` table concept. Verify if schema migration is needed or if existing tables are compatible with architecture design.

**Data Migration Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Database Migration Process]
- Use `pg_dump` with `--format=custom` for compressed backup
- Use `pg_restore` with `--clean --if-exists --no-owner --no-acl` flags
- Drizzle migrations run BEFORE code deploy (backward compatible only)
- Rollback migrations stored in `/server/src/db/migrations/rollback/` (if needed)

**Drizzle ORM Integration** [Source: server/db.ts]
```typescript
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import * as schema from "@shared/schema";

export const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { rejectUnauthorized: false } : false
});

export const db = drizzle(pool, { schema });
```
- **Connection Pooling**: Using `pg` Pool (default settings: max 10 connections)
- **SSL Configuration**: Enabled automatically in production via `NODE_ENV`
- **Migration Command**: `npm run db:push` (from package.json, runs `drizzle-kit push`)

### CDK Stack Integration

**Importing NetworkingStack Resources** [Source: infrastructure/lib/stacks/networking.ts - CloudFormation Outputs]
```typescript
// In database.ts, import VPC and security groups from NetworkingStack
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as rds from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-rds';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';

// Reference existing VPC from NetworkingStack outputs
const vpc = ec2.Vpc.fromLookup(this, 'VPC', { vpcId: cdk.Fn.importValue('NetworkingStack:VpcId') });

// Reference RDS security group
const rdsSecurityGroup = ec2.SecurityGroup.fromSecurityGroupId(
  this, 'RdsSecurityGroup',
  cdk.Fn.importValue('NetworkingStack:RdsSecurityGroupId')
);

// Use private subnets for RDS placement
const privateSubnets = vpc.selectSubnets({
  subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
});
```

**RDS Instance Configuration Pattern**:
```typescript
const database = new rds.DatabaseInstance(this, 'ScalemapDatabase', {
  engine: rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres({ version: rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16 }),
  instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.T3, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),
  vpc,
  vpcSubnets: { subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS },
  securityGroups: [rdsSecurityGroup],
  allocatedStorage: 20,
  storageEncrypted: true,
  multiAz: false, // Free Tier limitation
  credentials: rds.Credentials.fromGeneratedSecret('scalemap_user'), // Auto-creates secret
  databaseName: 'scalemap',
  backupRetention: cdk.Duration.days(7),
  preferredBackupWindow: '03:00-04:00', // UTC
  preferredMaintenanceWindow: 'sun:03:00-sun:05:00', // UTC
  deletionProtection: false, // Set true for production
  removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.SNAPSHOT, // Create snapshot on stack deletion
});

// Export RDS endpoint for ECS stack
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'RdsEndpoint', {
  value: database.dbInstanceEndpointAddress,
  exportName: 'DatabaseStack:RdsEndpoint',
});
```

### Cost Considerations

**Free Tier Coverage** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Cost Analysis]
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: 750 hours/month db.t3.micro = **$0** (months 1-12)
- **Storage**: 20GB gp3 = **$0** (Free Tier covers 20GB)
- **Backups**: 20GB backup storage = **$0** (equal to allocated storage)
- **Data Transfer**: Minimal within VPC = **$0** (same AZ transfers free)
- **Total Month 1-12**: $0 for RDS within Free Tier limits ✓

**Post-Free Tier (Month 13+)**:
- db.t3.micro: ~$13/month
- 20GB storage: ~$2/month
- 7-day backups: ~$2/month
- **Total**: ~$17/month (within $65-80 budget per architecture)

### Security Considerations

**Network Isolation** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Security]
- RDS in private subnets ONLY (no direct internet access)
- Security group restricts port 5432 to ECS security group exclusively
- No public accessibility enabled on RDS instance
- SSL/TLS required for all connections (`sslmode=require`)

**Secrets Management** [Source: Story 1.1 - QA Security Review]
- **CRITICAL**: Use `Secret.fromSecretNameV2()` pattern to reference secrets (NOT plaintext in CDK)
- RDS password auto-generated by `Credentials.fromGeneratedSecret()` - NEVER hardcode
- Update `/scalemap/prod/database-url` secret AFTER RDS deployment with actual endpoint
- Automatic secret rotation enabled (30 days) for database credentials

**Data Protection** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Security - Data Protection]
- Storage encryption at rest: AES-256 via `storageEncrypted: true`
- SSL/TLS in transit: Enforced via connection string `?ssl=true` and `sslmode=require`
- Automated backups encrypted with same key as database storage
- Deletion protection: Disabled for dev/staging, MUST enable for production

### Integration Verification Requirements

**IV1: Schema Integrity Verification** [Source: docs/aws-ecs-migration-prd.md - Story 1.2]
- Export schemas from staging and production: `pg_dump --schema-only`
- Compare using `diff staging-schema.sql production-schema.sql`
- Confirm zero differences in table structures, indexes, constraints
- Validate all enums match (assessment_status, domain_health)

**IV2: Data Migration Validation** [Source: docs/aws-ecs-migration-prd.md - Story 1.2]
- Execute row count checks across all tables (staging vs production)
- Verify foreign key relationships intact: users → assessments, assessments → documents
- Check for NULL violations in NOT NULL columns: `SELECT * FROM {table} WHERE {not_null_column} IS NULL;`
- Validate JSONB fields preserved: Sample `triage_results`, `priority_recommendations` structure

**IV3: Connection Pool Testing** [Source: docs/aws-ecs-migration-prd.md - Story 1.2 & NFR5]
- Simulate 10 concurrent connections from bastion host
- Verify RDS accepts all connections within `max_connections=100` limit
- Monitor RDS CPU/memory during connection test (should remain <50%)
- Confirm connection pooling works: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;` shows active connections

### Testing

**Infrastructure Validation** [Source: docs/architecture.md - Infrastructure and Deployment]
1. **CDK Synthesis Test**:
   - Run `npm run check` in `/infrastructure` (TypeScript compilation)
   - Run `cdk synth DatabaseStack` (CloudFormation template generation)
   - Verify no errors, template includes RDS instance, security group references

2. **Deployment Validation**:
   - Run `cdk deploy DatabaseStack` (~10 min deployment time)
   - Verify RDS instance "Running" status in AWS Console
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for RDS creation events

3. **Connectivity Test** (from bastion host):
   - Install PostgreSQL client: `sudo yum install postgresql16 -y`
   - Test connection: `psql "postgresql://scalemap_user:{password}@{rds-endpoint}:5432/scalemap?sslmode=require"`
   - Verify SSL: `SELECT ssl_is_used();` returns `t`

4. **Migration Test**:
   - Run `DATABASE_URL={production-url} npm run db:push`
   - Verify tables created: `\dt` shows all expected tables
   - Check indexes: `\di` confirms all idx_* indexes exist
   - Validate constraints: `\d+ assessments` shows enum check constraint

5. **Data Integrity Test**:
   - Import staging data via `pg_restore`
   - Run row count validation SQL across all tables
   - Query foreign key relationships to confirm referential integrity
   - Sample JSONB fields to verify JSON structure preserved

**No Unit Tests Required**: Infrastructure validated through CDK synth and integration tests

**Performance Baseline**: Document initial RDS performance metrics (CPU, memory, connections) in CloudWatch for comparison with Story 1.3 load testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The RDS PostgreSQL deployment demonstrates solid infrastructure-as-code practices with proper CDK patterns, security group isolation, and comprehensive CloudFormation outputs. The implementation correctly applies lessons learned from Story 1.1's security review by using `Secret.fromSecretNameV2()` pattern. Database schema migration was successful with all 9 tables, 11 indexes, and enums properly created. However, several critical gaps require attention before production readiness.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. All issues identified require developer action due to infrastructure deployment dependencies.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ (Clean TypeScript, proper CDK L2 constructs usage)
- **Project Structure**: ✓ (Modular stack design, proper file organization)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **FAIL** - No infrastructure tests added, only placeholder test exists
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - All ACs implemented but Task 2.4 (secret rotation) left unchecked

### Issues Identified

**SEC-002: Secret Rotation Not Enabled** (Severity: HIGH)
- **Finding**: Task 2.4 "Validate secret rotation policy is enabled (30 days)" remains unchecked. No `secretsmanager.RotationSchedule` found in DatabaseStack.
- **Impact**: Database credentials lack automated rotation per security requirements established in Story 1.1.
- **Action Required**: Implement secret rotation using AWS Lambda rotation function or RDS-managed rotation.
- **Reference**: database.ts:37 (credentials), Story 1.1 QA requirement for 30-day rotation

**INFRA-001: Backup/Maintenance Window Overlap** (Severity: MEDIUM)
- **Finding**: Backup window `02:00-03:00` overlaps with maintenance window `sun:03:00-sun:05:00` at 03:00 UTC.
- **Impact**: AWS best practices require non-overlapping windows to prevent backup interruption during maintenance.
- **Action Required**: Change backup window to `01:00-02:00` or adjust maintenance to `sun:04:00-sun:06:00`.
- **Reference**: database.ts:40-41

**TEST-002: No Infrastructure Tests** (Severity: MEDIUM)
- **Finding**: DatabaseStack has zero test coverage. Only placeholder test exists in `infrastructure/test/infrastructure.test.ts`.
- **Impact**: Cannot validate CDK template correctness, backup window conflicts, or configuration drift automatically.
- **Action Required**: Add CDK Template assertions validating RDS configuration, security groups, backup settings.
- **Reference**: infrastructure/test/ directory

**SEC-003: Missing Database-Level SSL Enforcement** (Severity: LOW)
- **Finding**: Connection string uses `?ssl=true` but no database parameter group enforces `rds.force_ssl=1`.
- **Impact**: SSL could be bypassed if connection string is misconfigured.
- **Action Required**: Add RDS parameter group with `rds.force_ssl=1` to enforce SSL at database level.
- **Reference**: database.ts:21-44

**PERF-001: Connection Pool Not Explicitly Configured** (Severity: LOW)
- **Finding**: `server/db.ts` uses default pool settings (10 connections) but doesn't explicitly set `max: 10` per architecture requirement.
- **Impact**: Implicit configuration could cause confusion or unintended behavior if pg library defaults change.
- **Action Required**: Add explicit `max: 10` to Pool configuration for clarity and maintainability.
- **Reference**: server/db.ts:11-14, Dev Notes "max 10 connections per ECS task"

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **SEC-002**: Enable automated secret rotation for database credentials (30-day schedule)
- [ ] **INFRA-001**: Fix backup/maintenance window overlap - shift backup to 01:00-02:00
- [ ] **TEST-002**: Add CDK snapshot tests for DatabaseStack configuration validation
- [ ] **SEC-003**: Add RDS parameter group with `rds.force_ssl=1` for SSL enforcement
- [ ] **PERF-001**: Explicitly set `max: 10` in pg Pool configuration

### Security Review

**Status: CONCERNS**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Storage encryption enabled (`storageEncrypted: true`)
- ✅ Network isolation in private subnets with restricted security groups
- ✅ Auto-generated credentials via `fromGeneratedSecret()` (no plaintext)
- ✅ SSL connection verified in testing (PostgreSQL 16.8 with sslmode=require)

**Critical Gaps:**
- ❌ **Secret rotation not enabled** - Violates security requirement from Story 1.1
- ⚠️ SSL enforced via connection string but not at database parameter level
- ⚠️ No automated validation of security configurations in tests

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

- ✅ db.t3.micro instance type appropriate for Free Tier and initial load
- ✅ 20GB gp3 storage with encryption
- ✅ Backup window in low-traffic period (02:00-03:00 UTC)
- ✅ Connection pool testing passed (10 concurrent connections)
- ⚠️ Default connection pool settings work but should be explicit

### Reliability Considerations

**Status: CONCERNS**

- ✅ 7-day automated backup retention configured
- ✅ Snapshot-on-delete protection (`removalPolicy: SNAPSHOT`)
- ✅ CloudWatch logging enabled
- ⚠️ **Backup/maintenance window overlap** could cause backup failures
- ⚠️ Multi-AZ disabled (acceptable for Free Tier, noted for production upgrade)
- ⚠️ `deletionProtection: false` (intentional for dev/staging per comments)

### Maintainability Considerations

**Status: CONCERNS**

- ✅ Clean TypeScript code with proper interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive Dev Notes with architecture references
- ✅ Consistent resource tagging (Environment, ManagedBy, Stack)
- ✅ Well-defined CloudFormation outputs for cross-stack dependencies
- ❌ **Zero infrastructure test coverage** severely impacts maintainability
- ⚠️ Manual deployment steps (secret updates) not automated

### Files Modified During Review

None - all issues require developer action due to infrastructure dependencies.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-rds-postgresql-production-deployment-data-migration.yml

**Critical Issues (2):**
1. Secret rotation not enabled (HIGH severity - security requirement)
2. No infrastructure tests (MEDIUM severity - quality requirement)

**Non-Critical Issues (3):**
1. Backup/maintenance window overlap (MEDIUM - reliability concern)
2. Missing database-level SSL enforcement (LOW - security hardening)
3. Connection pool not explicitly configured (LOW - code clarity)

**Risk Profile**: Medium (score 6/10) - Infrastructure story with security gaps
**Quality Score**: 70/100

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Address critical issues before production deployment:
1. Enable secret rotation (SEC-002) - Security blocker
2. Add infrastructure tests (TEST-002) - Quality blocker
3. Fix backup window overlap (INFRA-001) - Reliability concern

Story owner should address HIGH severity issues before marking "Ready for Done". LOW severity issues can be tracked as technical debt for future sprints.
