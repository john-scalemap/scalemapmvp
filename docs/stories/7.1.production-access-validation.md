# Story 7.1: Production Access and UI Flow Validation

**Status:** Approved

## Story

**As a** product owner,
**I want** live production URL access with working authentication and core UI flows,
**so that** I can validate user experience and identify any remaining integration issues before launch.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Live URL Accessible** - Production application accessible via public URL with SSL
2. **Authentication Working** - User registration, login, and logout function correctly
3. **Core UI Flows Validated** - Main user workflows navigate properly without errors
4. **File Upload Functional** - Document upload system works with S3 integration
5. **Assessment Flow Testable** - Can create and navigate through assessment questionnaire
6. **Error Handling Visible** - Appropriate error messages display for common failure scenarios

- [ ] **Task 1: Production URL Configuration** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Configure custom domain or use Elastic Beanstalk default URL
  - [ ] Verify SSL certificate is active and valid
  - [ ] Test URL accessibility from external networks

- [ ] **Task 2: Authentication Flow Validation** (AC: 2)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 6.5: Production deployment completed with AWS Cognito authentication, S3 file storage, and Elastic Beanstalk hosting. All infrastructure components operational and tested.

### Production Environment Details
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito User Pool (eu-west-1_iGWQ7N6sH)
- **File Storage**: S3 bucket (scalemap-storage) with ACL permissions
- **Hosting**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk with health check endpoint
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with migrated data

### Testing Focus Areas
- Cognito authentication integration with frontend
- S3 file upload/download with proper permissions
- Assessment questionnaire navigation and data persistence
- Error boundary handling and user feedback
- Mobile responsiveness on key flows

### Testing
**Manual Testing Required:**
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device testing for core flows
- Error scenario validation (network issues, invalid inputs)
- Performance testing under normal load
