## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 6.4 (Complete Replit Removal and Cognito Migration):**
- JWT-based authentication successfully implemented with Cognito User Pool integration
- Frontend uses `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` headers for all API requests
- Backend expects `req.user.claims.sub` for user identification
- S3 integration completed with ACL permission model preserved
- All protected routes use JWT validation middleware instead of session-based auth
- Application builds successfully and database migration to standard PostgreSQL completed

### Architecture Context

**Deployment Architecture:**
```
AWS Production Environment:
├── CloudFront CDN (Static Assets)
├── Elastic Beanstalk (Node.js Application)
├── Application Load Balancer (Traffic Distribution)
├── Cognito User Pool (Authentication)
├── S3 Bucket (File Storage)
├── RDS PostgreSQL (Database)
└── CloudWatch (Monitoring)
```

[Source: docs/aws-migration-architecture.md#target-aws-architecture]

### Critical Integration Points

**Authentication Flow:**
- Frontend: `cognitoAuth.getCurrentToken()` → `Authorization: Bearer ${token}`
- Backend: JWT validation middleware → `req.user.claims.sub`
- User data: Cognito attributes map to local user table

**API Request Pattern:**
```typescript
// Frontend (client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts)
const response = await fetch('/api/auth/user', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// Backend (server/routes.ts)
app.get('/api/auth/user', isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  const userId = req.user.claims.sub;
  // ...
});
```

**File Storage Integration:**
- Frontend: ObjectUploader component → S3 presigned URLs
- Backend: S3 ACL policies with `{owner: userId, visibility: "private"}`
- Database: File metadata stored with S3 object paths

### Environment Configuration

**Production Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Cognito Configuration
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=eu-west-1_iGWQ7N6sH
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=6e7ct8tmbmhgvva2ngdn5hi6v1
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1

# S3 Configuration
S3_BUCKET_NAME=scalemap-storage
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@rds-endpoint:5432/scalemap

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
```

[Source: docs/aws-migration-architecture.md#environment-variables-update]

### Performance Targets

**Response Time Requirements:**
- Authentication endpoints: < 1 second
- File upload initiation: < 2 seconds
- API responses: < 3 seconds
- Assessment loading: < 5 seconds

**Throughput Requirements:**
- Support 10+ concurrent assessments
- Handle 100+ API requests per minute
- Process file uploads up to 50MB efficiently

[Source: docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements]

### Monitoring and Alerting

**CloudWatch Metrics:**
- Application response times
- Database connection pool usage
- S3 request success rates
- Cognito authentication success rates
- Error rates across all services

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Response time > 5 seconds
- Error rate > 5%
- Database connection failures
- Failed authentication attempts > 10/minute

[Source: docs/aws-migration-architecture.md#next-steps]

### Security Considerations

**JWT Token Validation:**
- Verify tokens against Cognito public keys
- Implement proper token expiration handling
- Secure token storage in frontend (avoid localStorage for sensitive data)

**API Security:**
- CORS configuration for production domain
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for security events

**Data Protection:**
- HTTPS enforcement across all endpoints
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Proper ACL policies for S3 objects
- User data access controls
