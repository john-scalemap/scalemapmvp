# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-09-11
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** ScaleMap Founder

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** AI-powered application to disrupt strategy consulting industry for startups/scaleups blocked by operational maturity gaps

**Session Goals:** Explore automated end-to-end consulting platform with diagnostics → heatmap reports → targeted playbooks

**Techniques Used:** Analogical Thinking, What If Scenarios (in progress)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 6 major concepts across 2 techniques

### Key Themes Identified:
- High automation through agentic AI resources
- Input → Analysis → Output consulting framework enhancement
- Avoiding founder bottlenecks through scalable systems

## Technique Sessions

### Analogical Thinking - 10 minutes

**Description:** Finding powerful parallels to unlock new possibilities for automated consulting systems

#### Ideas Generated:
1. **Medical Diagnostic System Analogy** - Takes symptoms (operational challenges), runs tests (diagnostics), produces imaging (heatmap), provides treatment protocols (playbooks)

2. **Air Traffic Control Analogy** - Founders are pilots on wrong planes; ScaleMap offloads them to correctly designed aircraft with enough fuel, right size, and speed. Provides experience-based guidance and teaches self-piloting skills.

3. **Cookery School Analogy** - Founders bring ingredients (existing ops), make tomato soup (current results), ScaleMap creates unique bolognese recipe (optimized ops) and teaches execution.

4. **Radar Screen Operational Domains** - AI monitors key indicators like air traffic control:
   - Cash runway vs operational efficiency (fuel levels)
   - KPI measurement systems - "faulty instruments" analogy where analog altimeters (manual reporting) vs digital altimeters (automated KPI dashboards) vs no altimeter (no KPIs at all)
   - Mission/vision/purpose as propulsion system - needs regular topping up with "aviation grade fuel"
   - Network/airline membership - market analysis, trends, collaborative ventures (planes don't operate in isolation)
   - Communication systems - balance between product focus vs market focus; radio dies when founders spend too much time on product (lose market connection) or too much in market (team loses connection)

#### Insights Discovered:
- Air traffic control resonates most strongly - suggests emergency response capability and precision matching
- AI can leverage deep domain expertise like consulting firms repurpose materials, but with more refinement
- "Ops is ops" - while variations exist, fundamental principles are consistent and scalable

#### Notable Connections:
- All analogies emphasize transformation from current state to optimal state
- Focus on teaching/enabling rather than doing the work for clients
- Pattern recognition and expertise application at scale

### What If Scenarios - 5 minutes

**Description:** Asking provocative questions to unlock breakthrough possibilities

#### Ideas Generated:
1. **Proactive AI Detection Scenario** - AI detecting problems before founders realize they exist, with auto-generated custom playbooks
   - Feedback: Too embedded/intrusive for current model; better as analysis input and guided questioning during founder interaction

2. **15-Minute Diagnostic to $50K Roadmap** - Complete diagnostic and customized transformation roadmap in 15 minutes versus traditional 3-month consulting engagement
   - Key insight: Speed vs. perceived value paradox - slow=expensive/valuable, fast=cheap/less valuable
   - Proposed solution: Staged delivery approach:
     - Executive summary after 24 hours
     - Detailed reports after 48-72 hours  
     - Implementation kits 48 hours after reports
   - Strategic question: Should we deliver instantly just because we can, or respect human perception of value timing?

3. **Speed as Expertise vs. Managed Pacing** - Two positioning approaches:
   - Option A: "We're fast because we're more experienced" (reframe speed as feature)
   - Option B: Managed pacing to meet traditional consulting expectations
   - Key insight: Quality comes from combined human experience + AI analysis/synthesis + compute power
   - Pricing challenge: Avoid perception that 48-72hr delivery = low value, while staying accessible (not £50K, not £100)

4. **Value Positioning: Completeness Over Speed/Price** - New value proposition framework:
   - "McKinsey-level insights in 72 hours for a good consultant's weekly rate (£5-8K)"
   - Key differentiator: COMPLETION not just analysis - diagnostic + heatmap + implementation kits + follow-up support
   - Positioning shift: From "we're faster/cheaper" to "we give you everything needed to actually fix the problems"
   - Quality confidence: AI already outperforms many analysts in speed and accuracy

5. **Implementation Philosophy: Growth-Unlocking, Not Perfection** - Core principles for implementation kits:
   - Primary focus: Unlock growth through sustainable processes/practices
   - Anti-pattern: Consulting bullshit and bloat - intensely focused on what organizations actually NEED to do
   - Balance: Moderate customization/specificity while leveraging industry-accepted best practices
   - Approach: Bring proven methodologies to bear, not reinvent the wheel for each client

6. **Perfect Prioritization Concept** - Precision in identifying minimum viable operational changes for maximum growth unlock:
   - Example: 15 operational gaps identified → AI calculates 3 specific fixes unlock 80% of growth potential
   - Focus: Surgical precision on growth-constraining bottlenecks vs "nice to have" improvements
   - Value proposition: Perfect prioritization rather than perfect processes
   - Founder reaction: "OMG, if we could actually deliver this, I would be beyond thrilled"
