# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.2
schema: 1
story: "1.2"
story_title: "RDS PostgreSQL Production Deployment & Data Migration"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "RDS infrastructure is functionally deployed with proper network isolation and encryption, but critical security gap with missing secret rotation and lack of infrastructure tests prevent production readiness."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: high
    finding: "Database credential rotation not enabled - Task 2.4 unchecked, no RotationSchedule found in DatabaseStack"
    suggested_action: "Implement automated secret rotation using AWS Lambda rotation function or RDS-managed rotation (30-day schedule)"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Zero infrastructure test coverage for DatabaseStack - only placeholder test exists"
    suggested_action: "Add CDK Template assertions validating RDS configuration, security groups, and backup settings"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "INFRA-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Backup window (02:00-03:00) overlaps maintenance window (sun:03:00-sun:05:00) at 03:00 UTC"
    suggested_action: "Change backup window to 01:00-02:00 or adjust maintenance to sun:04:00-sun:06:00"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "SEC-003"
    severity: low
    finding: "SSL enforced via connection string but no database parameter group with rds.force_ssl=1"
    suggested_action: "Add RDS parameter group to enforce SSL at database level for defense-in-depth"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Connection pool in server/db.ts uses default settings without explicit max: 10 per architecture"
    suggested_action: "Add explicit max: 10 to pg Pool configuration for clarity and maintainability"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Enable automated secret rotation for database credentials (SEC-002)"
      - "Add infrastructure tests for DatabaseStack (TEST-002)"
      - "Fix backup/maintenance window overlap (INFRA-001)"
    monitor:
      - "Consider database parameter group for SSL enforcement (SEC-003)"
      - "Explicitly configure connection pool settings (PERF-001)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Critical gap: secret rotation not enabled. SSL connection verified but not enforced at DB level. Encryption at rest and network isolation properly implemented."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "db.t3.micro appropriate for Free Tier and initial load. Connection pool testing passed. Backup window in low-traffic period."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "7-day backup retention configured but backup/maintenance window overlap could cause failures. Multi-AZ disabled (acceptable for Free Tier). Snapshot-on-delete protection enabled."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Clean CDK code with good documentation but zero infrastructure test coverage severely impacts maintainability and change confidence."
