# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.3
# Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core

schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "API Container Build & ECS Fargate Deployment (Phase 1 Complete)"
gate: WAIVED
status_reason: "Deployment successful after significant troubleshooting. Multiple critical issues resolved during implementation reveal systemic gaps in containerization expertise and testing strategy. Production readiness achieved but technical debt and process improvements needed. MVP risk acceptance approved."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-09-24T14:00:00Z"

waiver:
  active: true
  reason: "MVP risk acceptance - HTTP-only deployment, container testing gaps, and infrastructure validation deferred to post-launch hardening. Team acknowledges technical debt and will address in Sprint 2."

lessons_learned:
  - "Vite and development-only dependencies must use dynamic imports in containerized production environments"
  - "RDS SSL connections require explicit certificate validation handling in Node.js pg library"
  - "ECS task secret updates require task restart, not just service deployment"
  - "CloudFormation stack timeouts can occur when health checks fail - manual intervention required"
  - "Frontend build artifacts must be included in Docker image for serveStatic functionality"
  - "Environment variable completeness should be validated in infrastructure tests, not discovered at runtime"
