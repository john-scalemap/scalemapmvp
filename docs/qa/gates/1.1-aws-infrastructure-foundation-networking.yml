# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.1
schema: 1
story: "1.1"
story_title: "AWS Infrastructure Foundation & Networking Setup"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Infrastructure is well-architected and functionally complete, but critical security vulnerability with plaintext secrets in CDK code requires immediate remediation before production deployment."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Secrets stored using SecretValue.unsafePlainText() in CDK code (networking.ts:85-115)"
    suggested_action: "Rotate all exposed API keys and refactor to use Secret.fromSecretNameV2() or external parameter references"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 1, medium: 0, low: 0 }
  highest: "high"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Rotate OpenAI and Stripe API keys immediately"
      - "Refactor secret management to reference pre-created secrets instead of embedding values"
      - "Verify .gitignore excludes cdk.out/ directory"
    monitor:
      - "Consider implementing automated secret rotation for database credentials"

  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Critical issue: plaintext secrets in CDK code. Other security controls (security groups, network isolation) are properly implemented."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Multi-AZ NAT Gateway provides high-bandwidth egress. VPC sizing supports future growth."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Multi-AZ deployment, proper subnet isolation, comprehensive CloudFormation outputs for cross-stack dependencies."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean TypeScript code, modular stack design, proper use of CDK L2 constructs, comprehensive exports."
